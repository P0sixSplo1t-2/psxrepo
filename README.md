## Introduction
- This is an attempt to get Minecraft Java run on a jailbroken iOS.
- Minimum requirements: device running iOS 12 or newer.

## Building
Requirements:
- Mac OS X (tested: 10.15)
- Xcode (tested: 11.7.0)
- Minimum iOS SDK: 13.4.
- JDK 8 installed
- `gradle` to build Java part.
- `cmake`, `wget`, `ldid`, `dpkg` and `fakeroot` to package.
Run in this directory
```
# Only run if you haven't installed JDK 8
brew install adoptopenjdk8

# Install required packages
brew install cmake wget ldid dpkg fakeroot gradle

# Give exec perm
chmod 755 *.sh

# Build natives part
./build_natives.sh

# Build java part
./build_javaapp.sh

# Sign with entitlements and package
./build_package.sh
```

## How can it work?
- Use OpenJDK 16 from Procursus to get real Java environment.
- Use MetalANGLE for OpenGL ES -> Metal translator.
- Use GL4ES for OpenGL -> OpenGL ES translator.
- Use our [LWJGL3 iOS port](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/lwjgl3).
- Use same launch method as PojavLauncher Android.

## Current status
- [x] Java Runtime Environment: OpenJDK 16.
- [x] LWJGL3 iOS port: works
- [x] OpenGL: GL4ES
- [x] Did Minecraft recognize OpenGL?
- [x] OpenAL: use @kcat's openal-soft
- [x] Input pipe implementation
- [x] Account authentication (partial).
- [x] Does it work? Partial.
- Currently, only Minecraft 1.6.1+ tested to fully works.
- Forge (1.13+), Fabric and OptiFine works well.

## Known issues
- (Some versions) Camera position will be jumped to random location on first time touch.
- It might crash sometimes, but try launch again until you get it works.

## Installing OpenJDK 16
### For Chimera/Odyssey bootstrap
- Add Procursus repository (https://apt.procurs.us) (usually Sileo package manager already come with Procursus repo).
- Find and install `openjdk-jre`.

### For other jailbreak bootstrap
- Download [openjdk-16-jre.deb](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher_iOS/releases/tag/v16-openjdk).
- Install and open Filza File manager.
- Go to where the .deb file downloaded.
- Open it and press Install.
- If everything fine, it will ends up with `Setting up ...`.

## Directory locations
- Account json directory: `/var/mobile/Documents/.pojavlauncher/accounts`.
- Minecraft home directory: `/var/mobile/Documents/minecraft`.
- You can also customize JVM Arguments in `overrideargs.txt` on `minecraft` directory.
